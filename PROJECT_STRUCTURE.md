## Resume Presentation Strategy

### Project Title
**"Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation: SLAM & Nav2 Demo"**

### Project Description
> Built a complete autonomous navigation system using ROS2 Jazzy. The robot simultaneously
> builds a map of an unknown environment (SLAM) while navigating to user-defined goals
> (Nav2). Demonstrated in Gazebo simulation with Turtlebot3 Waffle.

### Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

**Demo 1: Gazebo SLAM + Nav2 (feature/slam-gazebo)**
- ROS2 Jazzy — nodes, topics, TF2 transforms, lifecycle nodes, launch files
- SLAM Toolbox — online async mapping, loop closure, sensor fusion
- Nav2 stack — BT Navigator, planner/controller servers, costmaps
- Gazebo Sim — robot simulation, sensor integration, world creation
- Full system integration — 15+ nodes coordinated via lifecycle manager

**Bonus: Learning from Failure (archive/isaac-slam-nav2-attempt)**
- Systematic debugging over multiple sessions
- Root cause analysis (identified Isaac Sim OmniGraph TF bug)
- Strategic pivot when facing a blocker
- Clear technical documentation of issues and decisions

## Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about a challenging technical problem"
> "I was integrating NVIDIA Isaac Sim with ROS2's SLAM system. Everything worked except
> the map wouldn't build. After systematic debugging, I discovered Isaac Sim's Transform
> Tree node wasn't publishing the robot's dynamic position — the robot appeared frozen to
> SLAM even though it was moving in the simulation. Rather than spending weeks on a
> simulator bug, I pivoted to Gazebo where TF works reliably, and built a fully functional
> SLAM + autonomous navigation demo. This showed me the importance of knowing when to
> persist vs. when to pivot."

### "What's your experience with ROS?"
> "I've built a complete autonomous navigation system with ROS2 Jazzy — integrating SLAM
> Toolbox, Nav2, and Gazebo into a single-command launch. I'm comfortable with the full
> ROS2 stack: nodes, topics, actions, TF2 transforms, lifecycle management, and parameter
> configuration. I've debugged multi-node systems using ros2 introspection tools and
> have hands-on experience tuning costmaps, planner tolerances, and controller parameters."

### "Any experience with simulation?"
> "Yes — I've worked with both Gazebo Sim and NVIDIA Isaac Sim. I built a full SLAM and
> autonomous navigation demo in Gazebo. I also integrated Isaac Sim with ROS2 for a SLAM
> attempt, and learned how Isaac Sim's OmniGraph action graph and ROS2 bridge work at a
> deep level before identifying a platform-level TF publishing bug."

## Next Steps

1. **Record demo video** — 2-3 min showing map building + autonomous navigation
2. **Add git tag** — `v0.4-gazebo-slam-nav2`
3. **Commit current state** with clear message
4. **Merge to main** once demo is recorded and documented
5. **feature/isaac-cv** — computer vision demo (future)
6. **Update main README** with links to both demos
